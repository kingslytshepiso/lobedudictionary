A dictionary application for 'Khelobedu', 'Selobedu' or 'Selozwi' language; a dialect 
for Nothern Sotho and Sepedi. Geographically, the Balobedu are located among three 
ethnic groups: The Vhavenḓa (Tshivenḓa speakers), the Bapedi (Sepedi speakers) and the 
Vhatsonga(Xitsonga speakers) who are commonly found in most of the Bolobedu villages.

The application works as an API and is built as a rest api utilizing multiple endpoints 
to provide users a language reference for the language "khelobedu". A web application 
with an interface is planned for development and will be available soon but in a 
different repository
